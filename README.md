It automates:
- **Extracting** JSON data from 7 API endpoints (all from collegefootballdata.com)
- **Transforming** JSON data into cleaned, structured CSV files
- **Loading** Transformed data into a database

Features
**Flexible ETL Workflow**: Run extraction, transformation, or both    
**Data Normalization**: Cleans and formats string and numerical data to fit into a normalized relational database
