**Ofensive Passing Score:** A value between 0 and 100 indicating the relative performance of a team's ability to pass the ball effectively in a given season.
This score is calculated based on the total predicted points added (PPA or EPA) metric for passing plays in each game. Total PPA in a given game is weighted against the tier of the opponent, so more PPA against tougher/higher-tiered opponents results in a higher overal score and vice-versa.
